# Title
Tool Tracking Software

## Project Idea
This project aims to develop a tool tracking software to solve the problem of lost or misplaced tools in a workshop. The software will allow users to check out and check back in tools, keeping track of who currently has each tool and making it easier to locate any tools that are not in their designated place.

```
git clone https://github.com/loopstack-output/tool-tracker-app-backend
